**FitZone Gym - Official Employee Handbook**
*Last Updated: November 2025*

**SECTION 1: CODE OF CONDUCT**

All FitZone employees are expected to maintain the highest standards of professionalism. This includes wearing the official FitZone uniform (black polo shirt, black trousers) at all times while on shift. Personal conversations with members should be kept brief and professional. Use of personal mobile phones is strictly prohibited on the gym floor. Phones may only be used in the break room during designated break periods.

**SECTION 2: PAYROLL & COMPENSATION**

Payroll is processed on a bi-weekly basis. Payday is every other Friday. If a payday falls on a public holiday, payment will be issued on the preceding Thursday. Overtime is available but must be pre-approved in writing by a shift manager. The overtime rate is calculated at 1.5x the standard hourly rate for any hours worked over 40 in a single week.

**SECTION 3: PAID TIME OFF (PTO) & LEAVE POLICY**

Full-time employees are entitled to 15 days of Paid Time Off (PTO) per calendar year. PTO accrues at a rate of 1.25 days per month. Unused PTO does not roll over to the next year and will not be paid out upon termination. To request PTO, employees must submit a request via the online HR portal at least two (2) weeks in advance. For sick leave, employees must notify their shift manager by phone at least two (2) hours before their shift is scheduled to begin.

**SECTION 4: IT & EQUIPMENT USAGE**

The computers at the front desk are for work-related purposes only. This includes member check-in, class scheduling, and processing payments. Accessing personal email, social media, or any non-work-related websites is a violation of this policy and may result in disciplinary action. The Wi-Fi network named "FitZone-Staff" is for employee use; the password is "StayFit2025". Do not share this password with members.

**SECTION 5: HEALTH & SAFETY**

In the event of a medical emergency, immediately call 108 for an ambulance. Do not attempt to move an injured person unless they are in immediate danger. An automated external defibrillator (AED) is located next to the front desk. All staff are required to complete a basic first-aid and CPR certification course within 30 days of their hire date. The course fee will be reimbursed by FitZone upon successful completion.
